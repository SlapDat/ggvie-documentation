<!-- ## Project description

The SkillCentre Toolbox has been developed to cover many needs in automation throughout several sofwares and businesses.

Emerging due to operational necessities during the Totem Spain CoSv2 Build project, the toolbox has been growing ever since to range from CoSv2 applications to JIRA ticket system monitoring, by integrating GenerativeAI into its automation.
